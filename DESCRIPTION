Description: The 'veganUtils' package produces good looking and illustrative ordination graphics
  for vegan with less code. The package also contains other utility functions and extensions
  to improve the output of vegan objects together with tools to graphically examine
  nonlinear relationships in multivariate data. 
  Further, many plotting functions in 'veganUtils' are implemented using 'ggplot2'. 
  The package complements the 'vegan' package using solutions from these
  packages whenever possible.
